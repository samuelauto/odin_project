    <h1>Easy Fried Rice</h1>
    
    <h2>What Is Fried Rice?</h2>
        <p>Fried rice is a traditional Chinese preparation of cooked rice, vegetables, protein, soy sauce, and aromatics. 
            The ingredients are stir-fried in a large pan or wok for even flavor distribution. 
            An ideal use for leftovers, fried rice is quick, customizable, and incredibly simple to put together with whatever is in your fridge.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Fried Rice</h2>
        <p>Making fried rice is a breeze with the recipe you'll find below. The process is simple — preheat your pan before swirling in oil and aromatics, 
            then add uncooked proteins if applicable. Add in rice and vegetables, vigorously tossing ingredients for that toasty, golden-brown color that signals big flavor.</p>
        <ol><strong>Recipe Tips</strong>
            <li>Combine 4 cups of water and 2 cups of white rice in a saucepan; bring to a boil.</li>
