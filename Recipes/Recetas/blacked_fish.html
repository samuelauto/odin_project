        <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>
                Mix together paprika, dry mustard, cayenne pepper, cumin, black pepper, white pepper, thyme, and salt in a small bowl.
            </p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Heat a heavy cast iron pan on high heat until extremely hot, about 10 minutes.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>While the pan is heating, pour 3/4 cup melted butter into a shallow dish. 
                Dip each fillet into butter, turning once to coat both sides. 
                Sprinkle both sides of fillets with spice mixture; gently pat mixture onto fish.</p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Working in batches, place fillets into the hot pan without crowding. Carefully pour about 1 teaspoon melted butter over each fillet.
                Cook until fish has a charred bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn fillets and spoon about 1 teaspoon melted butter over each. 
                Continue cooking until bottoms are charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining fish.</p>
